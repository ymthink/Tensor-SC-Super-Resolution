# Tensor-SC-Super-Resolution

## Introduction

Based on the main structural features are approximated between the collected low-granularity data and the high-granularity ideal one, we propose that the dictionary pairs trained by low-granularity data and high-granularity have the same sparse coefÔ¨Åcient, and the sparse coefficients of the data are combined with a high-granularity dictionary to recover high-granularity data.
